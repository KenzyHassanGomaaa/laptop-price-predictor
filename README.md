# laptop-price-predictor
Web Application which help you to predict the laptop price bulid using SVR ml algorithm, and this the PEAS & ODESA for the agent

• PEAS

P => accuracy, speed
E => web application
A => SVR Model
S => Laptop features (inputs)

• ODESA

O => fully,
D => deterministic,
E => sequential,
S => static,
A => single agent.

• Continuous

• Agent Type => Learning agent

• Problem Formulation
- Initial State: The existing dataset.
- Successor Function: applying the SVR algorithm.
- Goal Test: provide an accurate price prediction with minimum prediction error.
- Path Cost: Zero.
